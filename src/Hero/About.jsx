We recognize that many NGOs tirelessly work to provide education, healthcare, and support to underprivileged children and communities. However, they often rely on informal channels like posters, pamphlets, and WhatsApp messages to recruit volunteers and receive donations, which leaves many potential volunteers unaware of how they can help.</p></div>
